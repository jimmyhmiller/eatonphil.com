# Fancy terminals in bash
## April 24, 2019

As part of my personal learning process, I try to throw out tooling
over time until I hit core elements. For years I've used zsh and
ohmyzsh on personal and work laptops to save time in the terminal.
The two biggest parts of ohmyzsh I don't want to give up are:

1. A nice PS1 (the terminal prompt)
2. Up and down arrows for historic search

And it turns out those two things are pretty easy to do in bash.



### PS1

The terminal prompt is set by setting the <code>PS1</code> variable in
bash.
